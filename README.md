Storykit Test
=====

Create an application where you can search for movies in the database and edit the grade of them.
Our intent is not that this application should be production ready in any way. 
Skip steps that you feel are gold plating for the application.

Minimum feature set:
* Search for movies in the database.
* Edit the grade (from 1 to 5) of a movie and have it updated in the database.

In addition to the solution meeting the minimum requirements, we will also assess things such as:
* Throttle requests in a manageable way.
* Handle race conditions.
* Ensure that you're utilizing TypeScript.
* Git workflow.
* Structure of html.

The delivery of your solution to us should be in the form of a repository. Private or not, it's up to you. Just make sure to invite us to your repo if it's private. Your repository can but doesn't have to be a fork of this repository.

In this repository we have provided you with a boilerplate that you can use to start if you like.
But feel free to change it and add the tools/framework etc to your liking.

## Getting started

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed and then run

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Documentation

For the API documentation it's available from [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

The boilerplate is built using [parcel](https://parceljs.org/).
