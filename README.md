Karin's Storykit Test: rottenBananas
=====

This is an application where you can search for movies in the database and edit the grade of them.
I have never used angular before, so I chose this assignment to try it out. If it's a catastrophe you'll notice.

Soon to be the feature set:
* Search for movies in the database.
* Edit the grade (from 1 to 5) of a movie and have it updated in the database.


## Getting started

With Node.js and angular-cli from rottenBananas repository:
```
ng serve
```
go to: http://localhost:4200/
